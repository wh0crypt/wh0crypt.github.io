RSA-256 was a challenge at the UTCTF 2024 where participants were provided with the values of *e*, *N*, and a ciphertext, all part of an RSA scheme. With this information, we needed to find a way to brute-force the key in order to decrypt the message.


# Description

The challenge originally weighed 1000 points, but since many people did already solve it at the time I did, I could only get 100 points from it. In this challenge, the info we are given is clear in the image above, the file `vals.txt`. Let's see its content:

```
N = 77483692467084448965814418730866278616923517800664484047176015901835675610073
e = 65537
c = 43711206624343807006656378470987868686365943634542525258065694164173101323321
```

## RSA Theory

We can identify two main parameters: *N*, which represents the *RSA public key modulus*, calculated as the product of two large prime numbers, *p* and *q*; and *e*, which denotes the *RSA public key exponent*, a positive integer that is coprime with the value of *(p-1) * (q-1)*, where *p* and *q* are the prime factors of *N*. It's worth noting that *c* refers to the ciphertext, which represents the encrypted flag.

For more information on RSA-256, you can check its [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem)) and this [CTF101 explanation](https://ctf101.org/cryptography/what-is-rsa/).

# Getting the flag

## Key cracking

Having this info is useless, since with the *public key* we can only encrypt; we need the *private key* with the which the flag was encrypted in order to obtain the desired plaintext.

> *RSA*, which is an abbreviation of the author's names *(Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)*, is a cryptosystem which allows for asymmetric encryption. Asymmetric cryptosystems are alos commonly referred to as *Public Key Cryptography* where a ***public key*** is used to encrypt data and only a secret, ***private key*** can be used to decrypt the data. - OSIRIS Lab & CTFd, [Source](https://ctf101.org/cryptography/what-is-rsa/)

Since we are not provided with the *private key*, we will have to brute-force it in order to deduce it. **Brute-forcing** a *private key* is a challenging process, as it involves finding the **prime factors** of *N* (*p* and *q*). Once the prime factors are found, we can calculate the *private key*, *d*, using the following mathematical relation:

$$
d = e^{-1} \mod ((p-1) (q-1))
$$

Where *d* is the ***private key***, *e* is the ***public key exponent*** and *p* and *q* are the ***prime factors*** of *N*.


## Use of RsaCtfTool

Creating our own script to crack *RSA encryption* could take a long time and might not yield good results. That's why it would really be helpful to use a tool that automates this process for us. Fortunately, with a simple *Google search* we can find an incredible and powerful tool called ***RsaCtfTool***, which does exactly what we need. You can find it [here](https://github.com/RsaCtfTool/RsaCtfTool).

I won't explain all the options that this tool offers this time, as it's not necessary. With the data we have, we can simply use the following command:

```
~$ ./RsaCtfTool.py -n <our_n> -e <our_e> --decrypt <our_c>
```
{: file="wh0crypt@kali:~/RsaCtfTool"}

This command would look like this with our parameters:

```
~$ ./RsaCtfTool.py -n 77483692467084448965814418730866278616923517800664484047176015901835675610073 -e 65537 --decrypt 43711206624343807006656378470987868686365943634542525258065694164173101323321
```
{: file="wh0crypt@kali:~/RsaCtfTool"}


## Actually getting the flag

And just like that, our output will look like this:

```
~$ ./RsaCtfTool.py -n 77483692467084448965814418730866278616923517800664484047176015901835675610073 -e 65537 --decrypt 43711206624343807006656378470987868686365943634542525258065694164173101323321

private argument is not set, the private key will not be displayed, even if recovered.

```
{: file="wh0crypt@kali:~/RsaCtfTool"}

And there we have it, our beautiful and desired: `utflag{just_send_plaintext}`


# Considerations

While this challenge was relatively *simple* and brief, it was enjoyable to revisit ***RSA***. It may not have been my favorite challenge, but it was certainly interesting.
